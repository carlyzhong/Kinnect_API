It started with tentative wobbles, then a confident stride or two, always accompanied by a huge grin. We'd been watching her closely for weeks, noticing her pulling herself up on furniture and cruising along the sofa. The excitement in the house was palpable as we encouraged her, clapping and cheering with every brave attempt. That glorious moment, when she let go of the coffee table and took three unassisted steps towards her dad, was absolutely magical. It was a mixture of pure elation and a touch of bittersweet realisation that our little one is growing up so fast. We know there will be plenty more tumbles and triumphs to come, but this first milestone feels truly special. We've got the video evidence, of course, ready to replay for years to come. What a journey it's been already, and we can't wait to see what other amazing things Sarah will achieve. Every day is an adventure with her, and we're just so proud of our determined little girl.",
